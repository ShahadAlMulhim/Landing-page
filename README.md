# Landing Page Project

The aim of this project is to convert static web page to an interactive one, by adding the navigation menu using Javascript and learn how to manipulating the DOM.

 Main Landing Page Behavior:
 - Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.
 - it should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page. 
 - When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.
